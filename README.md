## Overview
The purpose of this program is to store PDF files in Amazon s3
We want to be able to retrive those forms, so we will need a 
separate database in order to store metadata for those forms.

### Built With
This site is built with a Flask framework incorporating AWS S3.  There is groundwork for scraping functionality using "beautiful soup" however it is uncertain if that will be broken out into it's own repository.

## Features
Providing an easy way for patients and clinicians to find paperwork that can otherwise be burried or hard to come by.
